# GrowpNotes

GrowpNotes is a comprehensive platform designed to provide a wide range of functionalities through extensions. The goal is to help users organize their tasks, collaborate with teams, manage their finances, and learn how to develop web applications.

Developed by **GrowpStudios**, this project serves as a portfolio for both the front-end and back-end developers, with each focusing on their respective areas: the front-end (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.js) and the back-end (Java Spring Boot).
